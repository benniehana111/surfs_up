## Purpose

This analysis provides detailed temperature trend analysis for the months of June and December on the Hawaiian island of Oahu,  in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results

The analysis reveals that the temperatures on Oahu are relatively mild in both months. The difference in temperatures between June and December can be summarized as follows:

                 June    December
Lowest temp  -    64        56
Average temp -    75        71
Highest temp -    85        83

Temperature variability is also mild in both months. The standard deviation of temperatures is 3.3 degrees in June and 3.7 degrees in December. The temperature band from the 25th to 75th percentiles is 4 degrees (71-75) in June, and 5 degrees (69-74) in December.

## Summary

These results indicate that an Oahu surf and ice cream shop's business should not suffer from seasonal variations in temperature. However additional research is justified, to examine how the business might be affected by the incidence, duration, intensity, and co-occurence of (1) rainfall, and (2) wind gusts.
